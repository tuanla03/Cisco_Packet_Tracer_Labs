Network Model Description:
This model represents a network structure with 2 routers (Router 0 and Router 1), connecting laptops through devices such as Light Weight Access Points and Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC). Specifically:<br>
- Router 0 (IP pool: 192.168.0.2) assigns IP addresses to Laptop 0 via DHCP.<br>
- Router 1 (IP pool: 172.16.0.1) assigns IP addresses to Laptop 1 via DHCP.<br>
- The laptops (Laptop 0 and Laptop 1) connect to the network through Light Weight Access Points (LAP), which are managed by Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) on each side of the model.<br>
- Router 0 and Router 1 are connected to each other through network connections and devices such as Switches to ensure data transmission between subnets.<br>
- Routing between the two routers is configured to connect the two laptops, allowing the devices to communicate across the network.<br>
